# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Neural Style Transfer (NST) Project
This project consists of 2 parts.  
1. The first one is about applying GAN to generate night image from given day image, i.e. model converts day image to night image.  
**Pix2Pix** architecture is used.  
2. In the second part of the project NST algorithm is used. This approach uses style blending: the model takes content image,
two different style images, mask image and applies given styles to different parts of the content image using the mask.  
**VGG19** model is used as a CNN backbone.
